### Welcome Cyber Traveler,

In the past I tried to do allot of stuff at the same time. This is not recommended because I never get stuff done whenever I do that.

I have thus decided to only focus on [kodeboard](https://github.com/agamedev/kodeboard) and create a simple game which is the single use case for kodeboard.
